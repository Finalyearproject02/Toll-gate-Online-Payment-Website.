About This Project
The online Toll gate management system is designed to automatically keep track of the vehicle’s movement, and record the time and the details like the Owner’s name, date of registration, vehicle model, etc. This system is very useful for automatic vehicle tracking, time management, and also for automation of Tollgate. Online Toll Gate Management systems have been of great assistance in lessening the over-congestion that has become a part of metropolitan cities these days. It is one of the uncomplicated ways to manage a great run of traffic. The travelers passing through this mode of transport, carried by transport allow them to be aware of the account of money that has been paid and the money left in the tag. It relieves the traveler of the burden of waiting in the queue to make the toll payment, which decreases fuel consumption, and also taking cash with them can be avoided. Our system avoids this type of problem. Users get a gate pass online so they user doesn’t need to wait at the tollgate. this application is also secure for you.
